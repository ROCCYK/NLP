## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ROCCYK/NLP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NLP
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
